Not to judge, I'm just wondering after obtaining your BEng or BASc, why do some engineering graduates choose not become a P.Eng. later? Obviously if you ended up working for a place where there are no P.Eng. members to sign off on your experience, and / or you just don't want to put in the time / effort because you have too much going on in your personal life, or you made a career change out of Engineering early, or if you're an engineering immigrant who came to Canada and find the process.

I’m in the middle of my 8-month co-op and am beginning to think about what I want to do after I graduate. Working with some professional engineers, I was wondering whether or not it’s worth taking some extra time in receiving my full P.Eng and what sort of courses I would require in order to complete. peng Übersetzung im Glosbe-Wörterbuch Deutsch-Russisch, Online-Wörterbuch, kostenlos.

I' got a decent internship in Toronto last year with a large international construction firm, and I got another this summer coming up in Vancouver. Large construction firms seem to like the Jman Red Seal on my resume. This is my problem: The companies that hire/show interesnt in my application usually want to put me into the superintendant/field supervision role.

Both national engineering organizations in the United States and Canada are members of international agreements which claim to assist in Professional Engineer license recognition in the other country. These organizations are called APEC and IPEA. However, if you are a designated P.Eng. in a province in Canada, you still must complete all the regular license requirements and tests to get a Professional Engineer License in a state in the United States. For example, take a look at Washington. Буферизация может занимать от 5 до 30 сек.

Hi, Currently I have 3 years of experience as a project manager managing construction projects in Ontario. I know there are currently four categories when applying for licensing in Ontario: Application of Theory, Practical Experience, Management of engineering, communication skills and awareness of Social implications of engineering. Currently I believe I will have a hard time with the Application of Theory portion of the work experience requirements. For my job I manage engineers and archit.

I was wondering if in your experience/industry any of these designations or others have been useful? amp#x200B; For software/electrical engineers do you think something like any of the Cisco or Microsoft certs can prove useful? amp#x200B; I am more curious than looking to get any of these designations myself.

I'm a licensed Engineer in the province of BC and have been a professional of record on several projects before. I'm wondering why the following misconceptions still exist as I still hear these in boardrooms. 1. Misconception 1: We don't want to provide engineering P.Eng. stamped documents / drawings because of the liability issues. 2. Misconception 2: We don't want to ask our Engineer to stamp these drawings / documents because that's a big cost.

I have always been fascinated by geology since a young age and therefore, joining the mining industry (either for mineral exploration or mine geology) sounds like a good idea to work outdoors and earn a (more than) decent paycheck.

I work under an associate professor in the space engineering department at my school for my school's satellite design team. He can vouch for my work thoroughly and write me a good letter of recommendation, but here are my concerns: 1. He isn't my professor in any courses 2. He doesn't hold a PhD, and is an associate professor. Can I still use him as a reference for grad school and internships that require a professor's LoR? etc. NASA. Or do I have to network with my current/past/future profs. Бесплатный сервис Google позволяет мгновенно переводить слова, фразы и веб-страницы с английского на более чем 100 языков и обратно.

I'm a young economics graduate (B.A) from Quebec going back to school. I have always been fascinated by geology since a young age and therefore, joining the mining industry (either for mineral exploration or mine geology) sounds like a good idea to work outdoors and earn a (more than) decent paycheck. Recently, I have been accepted in Laval University in both geological engineering (4 yrs B.Eng) and mineral resources geology (3 yrs B.Sc (https://B.Sc)). I've met dozens of EITs that are 10-20 years into their career and have not tried to obtain their P. Eng or who refuse to pay the annual fee. A lot of Engineering positions on LinkedIn don't require a P. Eng either, just a full bachelor. Curious to know how many EIT's never get their full designation. amp#x200B; amp#x200B. 
I am doing the P.Eng exam this summer, and was wondering what kind of pay bump other engineers got upon receiving their P.Eng. I am a mining engineer that is based in North Bay, Ontario. I know that it will vary by discipline and location, but I am curious about others experience  Hello engineers, So i am in a bit of a predicament, I graduated with a bachelor of aerospace engineering back in June 2016 and I have been having issues landing a engineering job. I spent the last two years working as an IT guy and as a CSR in risk management/insurance. I have been constantly appying but most engineering jobs here in Ontario, Canada seem to be mid to senior level, it also doesnt help that both indeed and linkedin will show entry level but the employer website shows intermediate. I’m currently in my last semester of my 4 year university program. Going to graduate with a Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering in April. I never put much thought into what I wanted to do after graduating besides getting an “engineering job” in my field. I didn’t go the coop route so I don’t know exactly what I like yet. I do however enjoy my classes in Medical Imaging Modalities and Design. I’m wondering if going through EIT and obtaining the P. Eng license is worth it, specifically I'm just working on my P.Eng application which requires input from previous supervisors. I left a previous job on bad terms with an awful boss. Small company, so I answered directly to him. What if he doesn't approve the hours of experience that I am claiming under his employment or some such thing? Is there any recourse if pan out, i.e. is he required by APEGA to fill out the forms sent to him or how does that work? Thanks. I have just read that there is an agreement between the Texas and Canadian Engineering organizations, which states that pursuant to 1 year of acceptable US work experience and some other basic requirements, a P.Eng. in Canada could apply to become a P.Eng. in Texas.

Hello everyone, so I was offered an opportunity for a phone interview with a CAE Software company as a test engineer here in Canada. I had a few questions to anyone who has worked as a test engineer or is currently working as one. Is the future career path broad (can I go from testing to design to research) ? I have seen some bad reviews suggesting that moving up in the Company is hard, should I worry? (I might add if I am successful in getting this job this would be my first actual enginee. I heard the process takes forever for them to go through applications and such. Just want to make sure I don't screw up the initial application at all. Any advice from those who've done it as to what to watch out for or how to make sure it works out fine? Also, apparently the work experience portion has changed somewhat. Anyone know the main differences there. Hi everyone, I'm in a bit of a weird spot and could use some advice. amp#x200B; I'm from BC, Canada and I've recently got my 4 years of Engineer In Training experience and completed all of the ethics/law requirements to apply for my Professional Designation (P.Eng). While I haven't seen it yet in the application (can't get to the final page before filling out engineering examples section), I'm fairly sure that when I get to the end, it is going to ask me what my field of practice I'm currently pursuing a CS degree and was wondering if it is possible to become a senior software engineer in Canada or USA if I'm not a licensed engineer? Thanks. I got me P.Eng designation which is probably like most American's PE. I just feel a bit empty because I didn't get anything? I didn't get any raise and nothing changed at work. TBH I almost left my job last month I guess I feel a bit regret for not following through. Its a complicated reason for why I didn't leave, but it was risky. I actually like my current job, but I always wonder whats better out there. I kind of asked for a raise when I got my P.Eng, but my manger said thats not possible.
